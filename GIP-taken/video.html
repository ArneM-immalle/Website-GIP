          Hello everyone! We are three students who are very interested in IT-related stuff. We decided to make a funny video about the dangers of computer viruses. Of course, this video is ridiculous, but we want to make you aware of the risks. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Brent</br>
          You should never download anything suspicious on your computer. This could result in someone stealing your data etc. This video is about a quiz in which Mario and Luigi take part. We all like to play video games, so those two characters seemed very appropriate for the video. We hope you’ll enjoy the video!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Senne</br>
          In this video Brent Verlinden represents Mario. Mario is a psychopath who wants to destroy the entire world. Everyone thinks he’s a kind little boy, but he’s actually very dangerous and very good at coding. He has the most stupid ideas. I represent Luigi. He knows Mario very well and has some stupid ideas too. Arne Meylemans represents the presenter.

        <p>INT. Studio - Evening<br />
          The scene takes place in a small studio. In this studio there are several computers and a small desk for the presenter.</p>
        <p>While the intro sound is playing, you can see everyone walk towards their chair.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          Good evening everyone, welcome to the Techno-Quiz! We're here today with Luigi and Mario.
        </p>

          Good evening everyone, welcome to the Techno-Quiz! We're here today with Luigi and Mario.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          It’s me, Mario!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          We'll start with the first question right away!<br />
          Soon you'll see a clip and you're supposed to guess how it ends.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Luigi</br>
          That's a piece of cake for me!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          It’s me, Mario!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          This is the clip.

        <p>INT. Office - Evening</br>
          An office with a lot of computers in it. Three people are working in that office.
        </p>
        <p>An employee asks another employee to explain something.</p>
        
        <p>INT. Studio - Evening<br />

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Luigi</br>
          These computers are very old. I don't understand why these people still use them. I know they're going to explode!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          Mario, what do you think?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          I remember these computers from my childhood. I remember that my first adventures started off with Donkey-Kong.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          Mario, what do you think is going to happen in the second part of the video?
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>INT. Office - Evening<br />
          An office with a lot of computers in it. Three people are working in that office.     
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the employees stumbles over a cable. As a result, a computer falls off a desk.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>INT. Studio - Evening<br />
          The scene takes place in a small studio. In this studio there are several computers and a small desk for the presenter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Luigi</br>
          That person should be fired!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          That's too bad. Maybe you'll have better luck with the next question.<br />
          If you could make a computer virus all by yourself, what would it be capable of doing?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Luigi</br>
          Oh god, this one is easy.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          My computer virus would be capable of destroying the entire world!
        </p>
        <p>You hear a dream sound effect.<br />
          Creepy background sound.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p style="text-align: right;">DISSOLVE TO:</p>
        <p>INT. Studio - Evening<br />
          The scene takes place in a small studio. In this studio there are several computers and a small desk for the presenter. The edges of the screen have faded. This way you can recognize that it's a dream.</p>
        <p>Mario's going to sit behind a computer in the studio.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Luigi</br>
          Mario, what a good idea! Let’s do it!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          No, Mario, no! Don’t touch that computer!
        </p>
        <p>ario's programming a virus. He's typing on the keyboard.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          Here we go! We’re going to destroy the entire world! Mwahahaha!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Luigi</br>
          Don’t listen to him, Mario, let’s just do it! It’s the best idea ever!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          Mario, why would you do this?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          Everyone thinks I’m just a dumb guy, but I’m actually a genius. And now I’m going to prove everyone that I’m smarter than they think I am! Mwahahah!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          Hey Luigi, which country should we destroy first?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          Stop it now! Do you even know what you’re doing? Get out of here, Luigi!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Luigi</br>
          Mario, can you proceed coding?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          Uhm, Luigi? I think we have a big problem…
        </p>
        <p>Thrilling background sound.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          Mario! What did you do! Everything is going to explode!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Luigi</br>
          Well, it all makes sense now. These computers are as old as the ones in the clip you showed us! I told you they were going to explode!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          Don’t worry, everything is going to be alright.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Computer</br>
          Self-destruct in 30 seconds. (robotic voice effect)
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          Oh no, here we go again!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          We have to get out of here!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Luigi</br>
          You’re not going anywhere.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Mario</br>
          Well, are you happy now, sir? The virus isn’t going to work, but we will all die very soon!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Computer</br>
          Self-destruct in 5 seconds. (robotic voice effect)
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Presenter</br>
          Run for your life! Aaaaah!
        </p>
        <p>They're rushing out of the studio.<br />
          The sound of an explosion.<br />
          Funny background sound.<br />
